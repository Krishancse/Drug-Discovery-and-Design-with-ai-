## About

Drug discovery is a complex and time-consuming process that involves identifying potential drug candidates and optimizing their chemical structures for maximum efficacy and safety. AI and ML have revolutionized this field by accelerating the identification of promising drug candidates and reducing the cost of drug development.

This repository serves as a central hub for our research and developments in the application of AI and ML to drug discovery and design.

## Motivation

Our motivation for this project is to:

- Accelerate drug discovery processes.
- Reduce the cost and resources required for drug development.
- Improve the accuracy of predicting drug compound binding affinity.
- Optimize chemical structures for enhanced drug efficacy and safety.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:** We provide pre-trained ML models for predicting drug compound binding affinity.
- **Chemical Structure Optimization:** Our tools and algorithms help in optimizing chemical structures for better drug design.
- **Data Analysis:** We offer scripts and notebooks for analyzing drug-related datasets.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation on how to use our AI and ML tools for drug discovery.
